# Bad UIs

Welcome to the Bad UIs! This project showcases a collection of intentionally bad user interfaces.

## [Visit Gallery](https://swatishchoudhury.github.io/BadUI) 

This gallery features various examples of poorly designed user interfaces, created for entertainment and to  demonstrate what *not* to do in UI/UX design. Each BadUI is an exaggerated example of poor design choices, interaction patterns, or user experiences.


## Contents

1. **Simple Registration Form**: A form that tests your patience with unexpected interactions.
2. **Easy Unsubscribe Button**: A very "user-friendly" and "easy" unsubscribe button.
3. **Gravity Volume Slider**: Control volume with gravity, that's convenient.


## Contributing

Here's how you can add your own design:

1. Fork this repository
2. Create a new folder for your BadUI (e.g., `your-bad-ui-name/`)
3. Add an `index.html` file in your new folder with your badUI implementation
4. Create a thumbnail image and add it to the `images/` folder
5. Update the main `index.html` to include your creation:
   - Add a new `<div class="ui-item">` element in the `gallery` section
   - Update the `img src`, title, description, and link
   - Add appropriate data-tags
6. Test your changes locally
7. Commit your changes and push to your fork
8. Submit a pull request for review

These UIs are intentionally bad and should not be used as examples of good design practices. They are meant for entertainment and educational purposes only.
